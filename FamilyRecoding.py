# This code performs the compares the phenotype and genotypes of individuals in the same family and
# outputs a plink like file which can be used for GWAS or GWIS.
# the key functions are:
# __init__(self,SQLdb,plinkstem,phenotype,recodingMethod,depth): which takes a pointer to an SQL database,
#          the location and name (plinkstem) of the returned plink database 
#          (e.g. /test/test will write the /test/test.bed, /test/test.bim, /test/test.fam)
#          a string with the phenotype label, the recoding method (1,2,3), and the depth which to consider the family.
#
# There are 3 recoding methods which consider the comparision of family members
# 1) label change of phenotype between family members
# 2) if one person has a disease then label as affected
# 3) if progeny has a SNP which causes or protects (label by progeny)
# 
# The genotypes are recoded in the following way: (sticking with plink conventions)
# 1) if one individuals SNP is missing, the interaction is labelled as missing
# 2) if both individuals SNPs are identical, then label as homozygous.
# 3) if one allele is different between individuals, then label as heterozygous
# 4) if both alleles are different between individuals, then label as non-reference homozygous
#
# recode() writes out the database.  Each individual is treated as a parent, and using
# the functions in Pedigree.py, all progeny are extracted, and the comparison is perform with respect
# to parent and all progeny.
